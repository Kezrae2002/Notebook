60*60
>> 3600

#created a variable (seconds_per_hour) which I just used 60*60 to output the number of seconds there were in one hour.
seconds_per_hour = 60*60 
print(seconds_per_hour)
>> 3600

#I just used the variable seconds_per_hour and multiplied it by 24 due to there being 24 hours in a day and seconds_per_hour being the amount of sceonds in one hour. 
seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour * 24
print(seconds_per_day)
>> 86400

seconds_per_day / seconds_per_hour
>> 24.0

seconds_per_day // seconds_per_hour
>> 24
